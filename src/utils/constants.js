  bio: [
    "I'm a Full Stack software engineer with over 3 years of experience, focused on building scalable, production-ready web applications using React, Node.js, and Java/Spring Boot. I work across both frontend and backend, collaborating closely with product and engineering teams to ship reliable features that deliver real business value.",

I like breaking down complex problems and turning them into simple, efficient solutions that work well in real-world environments.",
